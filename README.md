# Blake - Your TFC Assistant

Hey rockstar!

My name is Blake and I'm here to make your experience as part of the Tranquilina Fitness Club as fun and simple as possible. Below, I've documented how you and I can work together to stay on top of your workouts and keep up to date on everyone else.

### Logging Workouts

---

When you've completed a workout, head over to the [Workout Logs](https://discordapp.com/channels/525441114648608780/525819670553690156) channel enter a message that matches the following format.

```
Ran for 40 minutes on 2/22
```

**Lets break things down**

```
Exercise          Duration          Date
  [Ran]   for   [40 minutes]   { on  [2/22] }
                                  *optional
```

- `for` and `on` are keywords i use to understand your message
- `Exercise` can be anything you did for your workout
- `Duration` is the amount of time you worked out. Acceptable time units are
  - min, mins, minutes
  - hr, hrs, hour, hours
- `Date` is the day you completed your workout. If you do not enter a date, your workout will be logged for the current day.

  - format is MM/DD

Here are a few examples of acceptable log messages.

```
Biked to work for 30 min
Punched bricks for 10 minutes
Jumped up and down for 2 hours on 2/22
Cartwheels for 1 hr
```

Once I've reviewed your log submission and found it's free of funny business, I'll record it and let you know all is good with a üëç. If anything goes wrong, I'll mark your submission with an ‚ùå and let you know if there's anything you can do to help me sovle the problem.

### TODO

- Interval updates
  - Post Status updates to the `general` channel
